# Summary
This is a lecture I taught (in French) to $3^{rd]$ year bachelor psychology students at Aix-Marseille University between February and April 2020. 

The lecture is derived across 3 courses (one .pdf file for each). 
At the end of the $3^{rd}$ course, students were instructed to install psychopy (Pierce, 2007) and run the experiment contained in the "PosnerTask" folder. This experiment is an adaptation of a task by Posner and Mitchell (1967) made in collaboration with [https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr/profile/alario-francois-xavier](François-Xavier Alario).

The task was choosen and implemented to give students a sense of the importance of experimental choices such as counterbalancing conditions, choosing a dependent variable, number of participants/trials, etc. The students were assigned a certain order of counterbalance of the conditions and the same number of participants and trials. 

Initially the processing of the collected data (df.csv) should have been in person, but French lockdown of March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic required a remote version of this last course. The results are therefore displayed and shared (Exemple_traitement.ipynb) as a python notebook (along with the html version of the same document).
